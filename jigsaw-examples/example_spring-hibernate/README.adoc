== What is this example about?

* Running a Spring Boot application with Java9.
* Using modules

=== Modules in this example

* currently only module mod.app, containing the main class (the SpringBootApplication to be startet by Spring Boot)

=== Module Dependency Graph, created with https://github.com/accso/java9-jigsaw-depvis[DepVis]

TODO

=== Example shows ...

A Java 9 application, using Spring and Hibernate, based on Spring Boot 2.x.
There are clean-, compile- and run scripts to build and start tests, resp. to run the application.

Currently work in progress.
Below see the steps we did so far to get this state:

* Spring Boot application, with one module (`mod.app`) containing only the (empty) SpringBootApplication.
* Compiles and tests ok with Java 11+
* Runs with Java 11+, via the Maven `spring-boot-plugin`, or as fat jar via CLI.

==== Step A: Preparing the project, Bootstrap with Java 8

. Configured and downloaded our application with the https://start.spring.io[Spring initializr] using Spring Boot 2.0.0 M5, to be run with maven.
We included
** Security for authentication and authorization
** Jersey for REST services
** JPA persistence
** H2 database

Now the application starts with Java 8.

==== Step B: Prepare for Java 9+ - without modules

[start=2]
. To compile and test, the Maven surefire plugin version 2.20.1 is needed.
`java.xml.bind` has to be added as module for test: `--add-modules java.xml.bind`
. We use the `spring-boot:run` goal to run the application (see `run.sh`).
The argument `--add-modules java.xml.bind` has to be configured here, too.
. We created a Eclipse project structure (including the m2e plugin).
. We introduced the Eclipse project `mod.app`.
It contains the `SpringBootApplication`
. To get this compiled, we had to drop `jersey` (commented out in `pom.xml`.
Otherwise we ran into problems with `asm` (version conflict with the asm version the compiler needs).
. The compiler needs a dependency to `asm-6.0`.
So we had to exclude the `asm` version from `plexus-java` (which wants `asm-6.0-BETA`) and set it explicitely for the compiler.

The application now compiles, tests and runs with Java 9.

==== Step C: Introducing a JPMS / Jigsaw module

[start=8]
. We converted `mod.app`into a module by adding a `module-info`.
. We then needed to solve more bytecode enhancement issues.
Therefore we declared the main class explicitely in the `spring-boot:run-plugin`.
This avoids letting Spring Boot search a main class itself, see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/10647
. Resolving a `javassist` problem by using the newest version 3.22.0-GA, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46132019/java-io-ioexception-invalid-constant-type-19-at-5
. Open the module (Adding `opens` directive to module-info.java).

[NOTE]
====
The SpringBoot Application (module) becomes a *top level* module, i.e., it is directly loaded as the starting point of the application.
It is hardly ever consumed as a module.
Therefore, opening the module will do no harm.

TODO: Extend the application with further (sub-) modules.
====

The application now compiles, tests and runs with Java 11+ and with a `module-info.java`.
Note that both tests and launch are still done on the classpath.

=== TODOs, LOP, Backlog, Ideas, ...

No software is ready, ever ;-) So here are some ideas left (any other feedback very welcome!):

* [ ] Introduce more modules
* [ ] Run application on the module path
* [ ] Introduce own entities for JPA persistence
* [ ] Introduce own Spring beans
