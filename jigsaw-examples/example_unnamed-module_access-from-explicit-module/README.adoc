== What is this example about?

=== Modules in this example

* modb, modmain, and also classes for the unnamed module (cpb)
* modmain contains a Main class which are started in run.sh

=== Module Dependency Graph, created with https://github.com/accso/java9-jigsaw-depvis[DepVis]

The examples illustrates the accessibility rules access to the classpath (i.e. from an explicit module on the module-path to the unnamed module):

* Normally explicit modules cannot access code on the classpath.
* The `Main` class in `modmain` can access classes in the unnamed module only, if an compile and run option `--add-reads modmain=ALL-UNNAMED` is set explicitely.
* Note also that the `Main` class in `modmain` cannot access any package on the classpath if an explicit module like `modb` has such a package exported.
This is here the case for `pkgb`.
The module `modmain` cannot access the class `pkgb.BFromClasspath` because it is somewhat "covered" ("hidden") by code in `modb`!

The script run.sh starts the main class from `modmain`.
