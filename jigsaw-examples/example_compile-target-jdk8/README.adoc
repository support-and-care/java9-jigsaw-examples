== What is this example about?

This example is about compatibility of code compiled for jdk 8 / 9 and running it with jdk 8

=== Modules in this example

* cpmain - classes on the classpath

=== Example shows ...

* Code compiled with target JDK 8 runs with JDK 8.
* Code compiled for target JDK > 8 does NOT run in JDK 8: The class version has changed.

To run this example, set a correct JDK 8 as environment variable JAVA8_HOME.

Note: No JavaDoc generation for this example.

=== Output

This example uses xref:../../README.adoc#golden-master-testing[golden master testing] to ensure output consistency.
The expected output is compared with actual output using `verify.sh`.

=== Maven 4 Migration

This example does not include a Maven 4 migration variant (`m4/` directory) because it is primarily about demonstrating compatibility with older JDK 8 code, not about the Java Platform Module System (JPMS).

The example focuses on cross-compilation targeting JDK 8, which is independent of Maven version.
Since the migration to Maven 4 in this repository focuses on JPMS-related module system features, and this example doesn't rely on JPMS, there is no need for a separate Maven 4 migration demonstration here.
