==== Loading Modules in Layers

Starter implements a primitive app server that loads modular applications from the subdirectory apps/ into their own layer under the boot layer and executes them via reflection.

For requirements on modular applications and details on storage, see apps/README.txt

* Applications are stored under apps.
Each application in its own directory "x".
Directory name = application folder name
* Configuration of the application via x/app.json
* The application's modules are located under x/mods/

e.g.

----
apps/example_requires_exports
> app.json
apps/example_requires_exports/mods
> modb.jar
> modc.jar
> modmain.jar
apps/example_hiddenmain
> app.json
apps/example_hiddenmain/mods
> ...
----

* app.json defines the root module as well as the main class and method to be started, e.g.:

[source,json]
----
{
  "rootModule": "modmain",
  "bootClass": "pkgmain.Main",
  "bootMethod": "main"
}
----

Note: "bootMethod" must be static and have String[] as parameter!
