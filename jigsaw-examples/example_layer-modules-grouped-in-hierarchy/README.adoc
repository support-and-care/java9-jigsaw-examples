== What is this example about?

This example is the same as https://github.com/accso/java9-jigsaw-examples/tree/master/jigsaw-examples/example_layer-modules-all-in-boot-layer[this example].
The main difference is, that the modules are not all in the boot layer but distributed over a layer hierarchy of the boot layers and 3 child layers.

=== Layers in this example

We have the boot layer as the parent layer for these three child layers:

* `foo layer #1` which contains the module `modfoo` which requires the automatic module `modauto1`
* `bar layer #1` which contains the module `modbar` which requires the automatic module `modauto2`
* `bar layer #2` which contains the module `modbar` which requires the automatic module `modauto2`

The boot layer contains these modules

* `modcommon` which has standard functionality used by all other modules
* `modmain` which does reflective calls to `modbar` and `modfoo`

Note that this graph has been changed manually as https://github.com/accso/java9-jigsaw-depvis[DepVis] cannot deal with layers for now.

=== Example shows ...

The examples shows what happens, if `modmain/pkgmain.Main` does reflective calls to classes in module `modfoo` or `modbar`, respectively.
Note that these reflective calls from `modmain` to `modfoo` and `modbar` are done from the boot layer to one of its child layers.

More remarks:

* Reflective calls from the parent layer (from `modmain` to `modfoo` and `modbar`) are possible.
* Reflective calls from the parent layer (`modfoo` and `modbar` to `modcommon`) would also be possible.
* `modcommon` is used from `modmain` and `modfoo` and `modbar`.
So it is resolved in the boot layer already.
* The child layers do not have a split package problem, though in `bar layer #1` and `bar layer #2` the same module `modbar` is resolved.
* Also `modbar` and `modfoo` can use different version of the automatic module `modauto1|2`.
No split package problem.

The interesting parts are all done in link:src/modmain/pkgmain/Main.java[`modmain/pkgmain.Main` here in this example].

You might also want to look at the differences between link:src/modmain/pkgmain/Main.java[`modmain/pkgmain.Main` here in this example] and
https://github.com/accso/java9-jigsaw-examples/blob/master/jigsaw-examples/example_layer-modules-all-in-boot-layer/src/modmain/pkgmain/Main.java[`modmain/pkgmain.Main` in this example example_layer-all-modules-in-boot-layer].
