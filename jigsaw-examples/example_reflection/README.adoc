== What is this example about?

=== Modules in this example

* modb, modmain
* modmain has a Main class which is started in run.sh

=== Module Dependency Graph, created with https://github.com/accso/java9-jigsaw-depvis[DepVis]

=== Example shows ...

Before J9 build b136, there was a difference between `exports` and `exports dynamic`.
In our example we've had a difference between the (exported) package `pkgb` with class `B` and the (non-exported) package `pkgbinternal` with class `InternalB`.

In modmain, we call methods of both classes statically (only B) and dynamically via reflection (`B` and `InternalB`), with variants of methods (public, private, private static methods) are all called via reflection.
In the `module-info` of `modb` there is no more distinction possible, both exports are `exports private`.

=== Output

This example uses xref:../../README.adoc#golden-master-testing[golden master testing] to ensure output consistency.
The expected output is compared with actual output using `verify.sh`.
