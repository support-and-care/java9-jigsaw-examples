=== Example shows ...

Before J9 build b136, there was a difference between `exports` and `exports dynamic`.
In our example we've had a difference between the (exported) package `pkgb` with class `B` and the (non-exported) package `pkgbinternal` with class `InternalB`.

In modmain, we call methods of both classes statically (only B) and dynamically via reflection (`B` and `InternalB`), with variants of methods (public, private, private static methods) are all called via reflection.
In the `module-info` of `modb` there is no more distinction possible, both exports are `exports private`.
