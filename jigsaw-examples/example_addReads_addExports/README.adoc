... how to use --add-reads and --add-exports for javac compiler and java launcher

All module-info.java files are empty.
All is done in compile.sh and run.sh in command-line options --add-reads and --add-exports for javac and java.

a) modb needs a read relationship to modc
b) modc needs to export its package pkgc to modb
c) modmain needs a read relationship to modb
d) modb needs to exports it package pkgb to modmain

This example uses xref:../../README.adoc#golden-master-testing[golden master testing] to ensure output consistency.
The expected output is compared with actual output using `verify.sh`.
