We are calling various classes from class pkgcpmain.Main (which is on the classpath, i.e. in the unnamed module)

1. Classpath code calling code in an explicit module on the module path
a. ... calling an exported class B which is in module modb: from pkgb.BFromModule
b. ... calling an internal, non-exported class which is in module modb - results in a java.lang.IllegalAccessError:
We caught the expected 'IllegalAccessError'

2. Classpath code calling a class which is also on the classpath
... calling BFromClasspath which is on the classpath: from pkgboncp.BFromClasspath

3. Classpath code calling a class which is on the classpath, but whose package name is 'covered' by a package in a module on the module path - results in a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError
NoClassDefFoundError: pkgb.BFromClasspath can't be found, as it is hidden by pkgb in modb!

4. Classpath code calling a class which is both on the classpath and in a module on the module path - will use the latter from module modb:
... calling B which is both on the module path and on the classpath: from pkgb.B (in modb)
