== What is this example about?

=== Modules in this example

* modb, and also classes for the unnamed module (cpb, cpmain)
* cpmain contains a Main class which are started in run.sh

=== Example shows ...

The examples illustrates the accessibility rules access from `Main` class in `cpmain` which are on the classpath (i.e. in the unnamed module).
It can access all classes both when ...

* ... they are in a named module in the explicit module `modb` (but only if the corresponding packages are exported!)
* ... they are in the unnamed module.

Note that is a class exists both on the classpath and in a module on the module path, the latter is taken.
Hence code in a module 'covers' code on the classpath!

The script run.sh starts both the main class `cpmain`.
