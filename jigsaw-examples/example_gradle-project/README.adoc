== What is this example about?

=== Modules in this example

* moda, modb, modc, modfacade, modmain, modmainbehindfacade
* modmain has a Main class which is started in run.sh

This example has the same content like xref:../example_requires_exports_requires-transitive_exports-to/README.adoc[example_requires_exports_requires-transitive_exports-to].
The only difference is that this example here is built with Gradle.
