== What is this example about?

=== Modules in this example

* Modules: momain, modb
* In addition, a directory modb-patch
* modmain has a Main class which is started in run.sh (without patch) or run-patch.sh (with patch)

=== Example shows ...

It is possible to patch a module (during compile- and runtime). Use cases e.g.:

* Whithebox testing: Unit tests need access to internal classes of a package.
See link:../example_test[example-test] for details.
* Fixing a bug in a third party lib: Prior to modules, it was possible to do this by correct order on the classpath - put the patch iahead of the classes to be patched.

To patch a module, the patching code is compiled resp. started "as if" it were part of a module.
The classes of the patch are added to the module (here modb), resp. overwrite existing classes inside the module if the module already contains a class with the same name.
See scripts compile-patch, resp. run-patch for details on the options to use.
