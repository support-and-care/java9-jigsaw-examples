== What is this example about?

=== Layers in this example

Only the standard boot layer, which has all modules.

=== Modules in this example

* `modcommon` which has standard functionality used by all other modules
* `modauto1` representing a third party library (in version V1)
* `modbar` which requires automatic module `modauto1`
* `modfoo` which requires automatic module `modauto1`
* `modmain` which does reflective calls to `modbar` and `modfoo`

=== Module Dependency Graph, created with https://github.com/accso/java9-jigsaw-depvis[DepVis]

=== Example shows ...

The examples shows what happens, if `modmain/pkgmain.Main` does reflective calls to classes in module `modfoo` or `modbar`, respectively.
All takes place in the boot layer, as the output of `modcommon/pkgcommon.LayerPrinter` shows.

So all modules `modmain`, `modcommon`, `modfoo`, `modbar` are in the same layer, in the standard boot layer.

As `modmain` does not require `modfoo` and `modbar`, we have to specify `--add-modules modbar,modfoo` in the run script `run.sh`.
