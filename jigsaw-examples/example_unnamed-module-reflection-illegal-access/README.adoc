== What is this example about?

=== Modules in this example

* The unnamed module (i.e. the classpath) and "normal" modules modb and modc.
* modb is accesses from the unnamed module.
* modc is not really relevant but only needed to allow a class in modb to be exported-to only to modc.

=== Example shows ...

The usage of the Java command line option `--illegal-access`, aka the "kill switch".
See https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jigsaw-dev/2017-May/012673.html[Java9 Maillinglist] for details.

Four classes on the classpath, i.e. in the unnamed module, access other classes with reflective access.

* `cpmain/pkgcpmain.MainCallingJavaBaseJDKInternal.java` does reflective access to a class from module `java.base`, package `jdk.internal` (a package which is new in Java9).
An explicit `--add-opens` is hence needed.
* `cpmain/pkgcpmain.MainCallingJavaBaseSunNet.java`       does reflective access to a class from module `java.base`, package `sun.net` (a package which has existed before, in Java8).
The kill-switch `--illegal-access=permit` will hence work.
* `cpmain/pkgcpmain.MainCallingJavaDesktop.java`         does reflective access to a class from module `java.desktop`, package `sun.awt` (a package which has existed before, in Java8).
The kill-switch `--illegal-access=permit` will hence work.
* `cpmain/pkgcpmain.MainCallingJavaBaseModB.java`        does reflective access to a class from module `modb` (a package which has not existed before Java9).
An explicit `--add-opens` is hence needed.

*Note that the kill switch **only works for classes which had been available before Java9**, i.e. were part of Java8. See also explanation https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/java.htm#JSWOR624[here].*

See all 20 different variants of how to use the `--illegal-access=...` command line option or the `--add-opens` option in the run script `run.sh`.

=== Output

This example uses xref:../../README.adoc#golden-master-testing[golden master testing] to ensure output consistency.
The expected output is compared with actual output using `verify.sh`.
