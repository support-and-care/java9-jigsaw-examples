== What is this example about?

=== Modules in this example

* modmain plus module org.apache.commons.lang3
* modmain has a Main class which is started in `run.sh`

=== Example shows ...

* Compilation, test compilation and execution with Maven
* Blackbox test with own `module-info.java` in `src/test/java`

The maven compile and surefire plugins recognize the test classes as an own module here, because there is a `module-info.java`

Note: No JavaDoc generation for this example

=== Setup

You might want to edit the Maven settings file `mvn_settings.xml` according to your needs (proxies, local repository path etc.)
The file provided here is just a copy of the original file from Maven 3.5.2 distribution.

=== Maven plugins

* maven-compiler-plugin Version >= 3.6.1 is needed
* The current surefire-plugin does not yet support modules.
It runs tests in classpath mode.

=== Output and Testing

This example does not use xref:../../README.adoc#golden-master-testing[golden master testing] because Maven output includes timestamps, absolute file paths, and version information that varies between runs.
See the xref:../../README.adoc#golden-master-testing[golden master testing section] in the main README for more information.
