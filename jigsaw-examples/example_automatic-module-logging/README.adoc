== What is this example about?

=== Modules in this example

* modmain
* slf4j*.jar as automatic modules
* modmain has a Main class which is started in run.sh

=== Example shows ...

The example illustrates the usage of automatic modules with logging.
We use three logging libs as automatic modules:

* slf4j-api-1.7.12.jar contains the logging interfaces (see directory ifamlib).
* slf4j-jdk14-1.7.12.jar and slf4j-simple-1.7.12.jar contain implementations for slf4j (see directory amlib).

The main class writes some logging output.
The run script runs the main class twice, once with slf4j-jdk14 as implementation, once with slf4j-simple-1.7.12 as implementation.

The example also shows:

* during compile time, only the interfaces are needed
* the mapping of names in automatic modules: The part behind the last "-" is interpreted as version and cut off.
Each remaining "-" is substituted by a ".".
