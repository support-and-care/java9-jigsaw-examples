=== Example shows ...

... how to use --add-exports in a manifest file for the Java launcher

We use Add-Exports in the manifest file of modmain to gain access to internal java.base classes (without a command line option)

For this to work

* modmain has to be started as an executable jar
* Add-Exports must be specified in the manifest file of modmain
* modmain has to be in the unnamed module
