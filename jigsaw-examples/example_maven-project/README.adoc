== What is this example about?

=== Modules in this example

* modmain, moda
* modmain requires moda.

=== Example shows ...

* typical structure with maven and two modules.

Dependencies have to be modelled both in the module-info and the pom!

=== Setup

You might want to edit the Maven settings file `mvn_settings.xml` according to your needs (proxies, local repository path etc.)
The file provided here is just a copy of the original file from Maven 3.5.2 distribution.

=== Maven plugins

* maven-compiler-plugin Version >= 3.6.1 is needed
* Note that the JavaDoc generation shows an error for `modmain` (probably caused by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MJAVADOC-498[this Maven plugin bug])

=== Output and Testing

This example does not use xref:../../README.adoc#golden-master-testing[golden master testing] because Maven output includes timestamps, absolute file paths, and version information that varies between runs.
See the xref:../../README.adoc#golden-master-testing[golden master testing section] in the main README for more information.
