== What is this example about?

=== Modules in this example

* modb, modmain
* modmain has a Main class which is started in run.sh

=== Module Dependency Graph, created with https://github.com/accso/java9-jigsaw-depvis[DepVis]

=== Example shows ...

* addReads via reflection

modmain/Main adds a read relationship to modb dynamically via reflection

* addExports via reflection

modb/pkgbinternal is also exported to modmain via reflection.
For that, modmain/Main asks the (exported!) pkgb.BHelper to do this addExports.
Adding cannot be done in modmain/Main directly, as the reflection method is caller-sensitive!

Note that for successful compilation, modmain/Main needs access to the exported BHelper.
Therefore the option --add-exports is needed.
Same thing during runtime.
