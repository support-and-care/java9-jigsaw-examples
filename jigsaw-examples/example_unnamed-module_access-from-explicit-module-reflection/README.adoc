== What is this example about?

=== Modules in this example

* modb, modmain, and also classes for the unnamed module (cpb)
* modmain contains a Main class which is started in run.sh

The examples illustrates the accessibility rules access to the classpath (i.e. from an explicit module on the module-path to the unnamed module) with reflective access:

* Reflective access from a module to the classpath works, as reflection has implicit readability (no --add-reads modmain=ALL-UNNAMED necessary)
* Note also that the `Main` class in `modmain` cannot access any package on the classpath if an explicit module like `modb` has such a package exported.
This is here the case for `pkgb`.
The module `modmain` cannot access the class `pkgb.BFromClasspath` because it is "covered" ("hidden") by code in `modb`!
This is also the case for reflective access.

The script run.sh starts the main class from `modmain`.
