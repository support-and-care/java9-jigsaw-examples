== What is this example about?

=== Modules in this example

* modb, modmain, modmainbar, modsplitbar1, modsplitbar2, modmainfoo, modsplitfoo1, modsplitfoo2
* modmain has a Main class which is started in run.sh

=== Module Dependency Graph, created with https://github.com/accso/java9-jigsaw-depvis[DepVis]

=== Example shows ...

Case 1)

* modsplitfoo1 and modsplitfoo2 do both contain a package called pkgfoo.
* modmainfoo requires modsplitfoo1 and modsplitfoo2
Does not compile!
A module must not requires 2 or more modules, which have/export the same package

Case 2)

* modsplitbar1 and modsplitbar2 do both contain a package called pkgbar (not exported).
* modmainbar requires modsplitbar1
* During runtime, --add-modules is used to load also modsplitbar2
Shows a runtime exception:
In one classloader, two or more modules must not be loaded, which have/export the same package.

=== TODOs

* [ ] Does case 2 work, if the classloader for modsplitbar1 and modsplitbar2 is different (i.e., what about layers)?
