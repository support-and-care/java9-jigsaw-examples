== What is this example about?

=== Modules in this example

* modb, modc, modmain
* modmain has a Main class which is started in run.sh
* Note the explicit --add-modules option to make sure that modb and modc are available (otherwise you will see: `Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: pkgb/B`)

=== Module Dependency Graph, created with https://github.com/accso/java9-jigsaw-depvis[DepVis]

=== Example shows ...

* Usage of `requires static` and `requires static transitive` for optional dependencies for modules, needed at compile time but don't want to force its presence at runtime.
So we mark such a dependency as being optional with the `static` modifier.
