=== Modules in this example

* TODO
* modmain has a Main class which is started in run.sh

=== Module Dependency Graph, created with https://github.com/accso/java9-jigsaw-depvis[DepVis]

Example for

* resolvedmods: What is loaded?

Modules moda, modb (requires moda), modc

The Main method in each module outputs the modules in the boot layer:

* moda/pkga.AMain: The boot layer contains java., jdk. and moda
* modb/pkgB.BMain: The boot layer contains java., jdk., moda, modb
* modc/pkgC.CMain: The boot layer contains java., jdk., modc
* modb/pkgb.BMain with --add-modules modc: The boot layer contains java., jdk., moda, modb, modc

Although only java.base is required, some java.* modules are loaded (java.rmi, java.scripting, java.logging, ...)

An automatic module is only loaded if it is also required.
First the configuration is created based on the required relationships, then the read edges for automatic modules are added.

See also "State of the Module System":

*After* a module graph is resolved, therefore, an automatic module
is made to read every other named module, whether automatic or explicit.

=== Output

This example uses xref:../../README.adoc#golden-master-testing[golden master testing] to ensure output consistency.
The expected output is compared with actual output using `verify.sh`.
