== What is this example about?

This example is not really about the Jigsaw/JPMS module system. Instead it shows that usage of the new versioning scheme.

For more background information, refer to https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/223[JEP 223].

== Sample output

This is sample output of the main class (example shown with Temurin-11.0.27+6):

----
Runtime.version() says, we are using Java version 11.0.27, build version 6
System properties say, we are using Java version as follows:
  java.version = 11.0.27
  java.runtime.version = 11.0.27+6
  java.vm.version = 11.0.27+6
  java.specification.version = 11
  java.vm.specification.version = 11
----

[NOTE]
====
The output will vary depending on your installed Java version.
This example demonstrates the version string format introduced in JEP 223 (Java 9).

=== Output

This example uses xref:../../README.adoc#golden-master-testing[golden master testing] to ensure output consistency.
The expected output is compared with actual output using `verify.sh`.
